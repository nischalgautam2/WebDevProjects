# 😎 Emoji-selector
I have built out a simple chat-app application. I have created an easy-to-use emoji selector for this website. 

## 🚀 APIs used
- [Open Emoji API](https://emoji-api.com/)
### 🎯 Get your API key here
- Head on over to the [Open Emoji API](https://emoji-api.com/). You should see a field for you to put in your email address with a button saying get a key.

- Go ahead and put in a valid email address. You'll then receive your API key.

- Do not copy my key. Be sure to create your own by providing your email address. Once you have your API key, scroll down to "Documentation" and you'll notice all the different API endpoints. The only one we'll be using for this project is the first one titled "List all emojis". 
- You should copy your API key at the end of the link for the API after "?access_key=".
